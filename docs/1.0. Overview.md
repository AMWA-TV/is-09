## Documentation

The documents included in this directory provide additional details and recommendations for implementations of the defined API, and its consumers.

## Introduction

The purpose of this document is to explain the purpose of the NMOS System Resource and how an NMOS Node can access this.

The terms 'Node', 'Device', 'Sender' and 'Receiver' will be used extensively throughout this document. Please refer to the core [NMOS Technical Overview](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos/blob/master/NMOS%20Technical%20Overview.md) for definitions of these.

## API Definition

The System API provides a single API resource via the path `/global`. This path is used to define global constants which apply to the system in which Nodes are deployed. With the exception of the System ID, these constants are defined within the schema for the global resource.

### System ID

The System ID is exposed via the `id` attribute of the `/global` resource. This is the ID of the system and is expected to be constant for the "life" of the system. This ID MUST be assigned randomly in each facility which deploys a System API.

## API Interaction

The System API is provided such that Nodes can gather require configuration parameters at startup.  If the System API is not available, stored values from previous operation may be used.
