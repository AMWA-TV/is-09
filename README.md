[//]: # "INTRO-START"

### What does it do?

- Allows an NMOS Node (also known as a "Media Node") to obtain global configuration parameters that are common across the system.

### Why does it matter?

- Enables the Node to start, or re-start, in a well defined way that is consistent with the environment it's running in.

### How does it work?

- Defines the System API 'global configuration resource' and the expected behaviour for Nodes using it.

[//]: # "INTRO-END"
