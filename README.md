# \[Work In Progress\] AMWA IS-09 NMOS System API

The NMOS System API allows an NMOS Node (also known as a "Media Node") to find Resources that are common across a system.
This enables the Node to start, or re-start, in a well defined way that is consistent with the environment it's running in.

## Getting started

Readers are advised to be familiar with:
*   The [JT-NM Reference Architecture](http://jt-nm.org/RA-1.0/)
*   The [overview of Networked Media Open Specifications](https://github.com/AMWA-TV/nmos)

Readers should then read the [documentation](docs/) in this repository, and the [APIs](APIs/), which are written in RAML -- if a suitable tool is not available for reading this, then [this](APIs/generateHTML) will create HTML versions.
